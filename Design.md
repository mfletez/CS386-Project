#*1. Description*
WalkItOff is an app for those people that have a rough time waking up in the morning, this will change the way they start their day. The user will set an alarm and walk a set distance to turn off the alarm when it goes off. Location services are used to pinpoint the user's location. The app has a leveling up system that will allow users to unlock different sounds to use as new alarms. The app has a high score system so that there is some competition and motivation for all the users.

#*2. Architecture*
The WalkItOff app has two components, the MYSQL database, and the Android application. Similar to the examples given we have split these into two packages.Classes are also listed as packages within the larger packages, these represent the individual classes and their respective functions,which will help facilitate the display of the interconnectivities. The dotted lines serve to represent the individual connectivities between class packages.
